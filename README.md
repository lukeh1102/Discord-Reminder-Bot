# Discord-Reminder-Bot
This is a bot that I created for Discord that uses a google calender api to keep track and post reminders in your servers for upcoming events. Discord is a VoIP and instant messaging social platform and I use it for my classes in school, in these servers we can discuss the course and would post reminder for upcoming due dates. This process became tedious so I created a bot that would keep track of upcoming assignments for each class and then post reminders to the server.
